# HoriseonRefactory-

As a future developer I will be givin existing code that needs to be refactored. Just like what I have here with Horiseons website. I improved the code using Semantic Elements to not only add additional meaning but to also improve readability of the code and also make it accessible to screen readers. 

The first step to install my code is to click the link on my reposition on github titled "HoriseonRefactory".
 Second, you will have to copy the ssh key and then open your terminal on your computor. 
 Next, you will enter the following commands inside of the file you choose. 
 - git add .
 - git commit -m "initial code"
 - git push origin main
 once the repository is done downloadding enter the command.
 -ls   
 You should see "HoriseonRefactory" listed inside of your directory.

 Finally, open your Vscode and open up the "horiseonRefactory" file and the code is officially installed.
